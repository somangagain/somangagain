### Hello, I’m an active problem solver, **resomang**.

------

I started my journey in 2012, inspired by a massive book that was larger than my face. That early fascination led me into the world of programming, where I discovered endless possibilities for innovation.

I’m someone who enjoys solving complex problems with knowledge and technology, always striving to find better and more efficient solutions. Whether it's developing software, solving algorithmic challenges, or exploring new fields in tech, I am constantly motivated to learn and grow.

I believe in continuous improvement. The excitement of tackling challenges, learning from mistakes, and achieving breakthroughs drives me forward. I am always looking for ways to innovate and push the boundaries of what I can accomplish.

I also carefully examine a broad range of social issues, translating them into addressable technical tasks to develop practical and effective solutions. Through this process, I strive to create tangible value and foster meaningful change in society.
